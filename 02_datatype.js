/*

In JavaScript, there are primarily two categories of data types: primitive data types and reference data types.

2. Primitive Data Types:

Number: Represents numeric values, e.g., 5, 3.14.
String: Represents textual data, e.g., "Hello, World!".
Boolean: Represents true or false.
Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
Null: Represents an intentional absence of any object value.
Symbol (introduced in ECMAScript 6): Represents a unique and immutable value and is often used as an identifier for object properties.

2. Reference Data Types:

Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs, e.g., {name: "John", age: 30}.
Array: Represents a collection of elements, e.g., [1, 2, 3].
Function: Represents a callable object, e.g., function add(a, b) { return a + b; }.
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable. The type of the variable is determined dynamically at runtime based on the value assigned to it.
